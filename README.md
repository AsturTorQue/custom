## Translations
You can help to translate this app into your own language.

See https://github.com/gtxent/custom/tree/master/app/src/main/res
You will see folders with values-de,values-es, values-fr, etc.
In these folders you will find a strings.xml file.
In these files you will find lines like:
`<string name="Reboot_to_TWRP">Reboot to TWRP</string>`
The second part "Reboot to TWRP" is the string to be translated.

If your language is not in the list yet, simply take the strings.xml from the main values folder, so `/values/strings.xml`.
Create your translation.
**Note:** Do use an editor that can handle unix linefeeds. Do **NOT** use windows notepad. Instead use a tool like Notepad++ (if you are on Windows)

If you are ready, create an issue (top menu of this page) and call it something like "Finnish translation" (or whatever your language is). Attach your file and again: specify which language it is!
